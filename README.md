# tic-tac-toe

A basic tic-tac-toe game playable from the command line.

## Requirements

Run `npm install` and wait for all dependancies to finish installing. Then run `npm start` to start a game!

## How to Play

When prompted, enter a coordinate like `A1` or `C3` to place your mark on the grid. By default, the first player is 'X' while the second is 'O'. The game automatically checks the grid for a winner and will stop the game when someone gets a row, column, or diagonal. To start another game, type `reset`. To exit, type `exit`.
